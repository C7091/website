## Objectives


-Indexing concept

-Using `which()` and subsetting

-Selection on `data.frame` objects

-Using `aggregate()`


## Indexing concept

Vectors, Matrices and arrays.  Oh my!

Think of houses on a street

Each street has an address...


## Indexing concept

Indexing

```
my_vector <- c(11.3, 11.2, 10.4, 10.4, 8.7, 10.8, 10.5, 10.3, 9.7, 11.2)
  
my_vector
```

## Indexing concept

Vectors

```
my_vector        
my_vector[ ]     
my_vector[ 1:10] 
```               
               

## Indexing concept

Matrices
```
my_matrix <- matrix(data = c(2,3,4,5,6,6,6,6), nrow = 2, byrow = T)
my_matrix[1:2,3:4]
```                    

## Using `which()` and subsetting

A way to exploit indices

```
which(vector_a > 5)
which.min(vector_a)
which.max(vector_a)
```


## Selection on `data.frame` objects

- A data frame consists of variables (columns) and observations (rows)
- All rows of a column are coerced to have the same data type
- The columns are named
- Accessing the contents of a data frame is again similar to accessing a matrix
- what is the difference between a matrix and dataframe?

## Slicing data

```
data(OrchardSprays)
OrchardSprays$treatment == "D" 
```

## Using `aggregate()`

Very useful to summarize your data

```
# NB use of list() and naming it "treatment"

aggregate(x = OrchardSprays$decrease, by = list(treatment = OrchardSprays$treatment), FUN = mean)
```
