## Objectives

- Function tour

- Using functions and getting help

- R packages

- Finding, downloading and using packages

- Practice exercises


## Function tour

`function_name()`

<br>

Note:

- `function_name` is the name (usually contextual meaning)

- EVERY function has brackets `()`


## Using R functions

```r
function_name(argument_1 = value_1, 
              argument_2 = value_2, 
              ...)
```
<br>

- Arguments are like "settings" for functions

- Each argument has a unique name

- Arg values assigned by "`=`" and separated by "`,`"

- "`...`" means there are optional args (ignore for now)

## Function names

```r
`mean()` # Calculates the arithmetic mean

`log()` # Calculates the log

`sd()` # Calculates the standard deviation

`plot()` # Draws plots

`help()` # Used to access help pages
```

...you get the idea

## Using functions and help

Demo

```r
## A workflow for using functions ####
help(c) # We use this a lot - it "combines" numbers
c(2, 6, 7, 8.1, 5, 6) 

...

```


## R packages

- Extremely useful, mandatory

- Lots of them (>20,000)

- Community made

- Must discover them

- Must learn to use them, their functions


## Installing packages

Demo

```r
# Step 1: install a package

help(install.packages) # just have a look
install.packages(pkgs = "package_name")
```
